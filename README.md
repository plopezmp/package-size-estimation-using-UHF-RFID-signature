# Package Size Estimation Using UHF RFID Signature

This repository contains datasets representing a combination of reading scenarios for package size estimation using UHF RFID signature. The scenarios are categorized based on three key factors:

- **Type of Scenario (First Letter):**
  - (I) Ideal
  - (S) Simple
  - (C) Complex

- **Distance Between Antennas (Second Letter):**
  - (P) 2 m
  - (M) 2.5 m
  - (G) 3 m

- **Number of Boxes in the Tested Dataset (Third Letter):**
  - (P) 4 boxes
  - (M) 8 boxes
  - (G) 16 boxes

The files in TL1SXM, TL2SMF, and TL3NMM correspond to the data and results of the transfer learning approach.

The files in TL1, TL2, and TL3 correspond to the data traces used in the transfer learning approach. TL1, TL2 and TL3 correspond with setups derived from the *reference escenario*, SMM.
- **TL1:** considers a different gate dimensions: $d$=2.25 m, $h_a$=2.25 m, $h_b$ = 1.2 m.
- **TL2:** adds two boxes to the (M) boxes set.
- **TL2:** considers new random conditions for the packages placement. This setup is more realistic and difficult to tackle.


## Data Explanation

The interrogation process utilizes Frequency Sweep Algorithm (FSA) with a fixed frame length of 16 slots. The experiment has been repeated 20,000 times, each with a random package configuration, to construct datasets for training the predictive system.

### Index File

The `index` file summarizes high-level statistics for the interrogation procedure of each package. Each row in the `index` file contains information such as the LxWxH dimensions of the box or its position with respect to the antennas.

### Frames File

The `frames` file provides low-level statistics for each interrogation frame. It includes detailed statistics for each frame, as the interrogation procedure for each package typically comprises multiple frames.

Example of statistics collected:

(Note: The interrogation procedure for each package usually comprises multiple frames. For instance, the first package was inventoried in the first 12 frames, with the last tag identified in frame 12.)

These datasets have been utilized to train Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) of different architectures. For detailed results, please refer to the paper:
